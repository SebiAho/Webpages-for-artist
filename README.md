# Webpages-for-artist
Webpages I made for my Vocational Institute studies.
The now defunct webpages were essentially an art gallery, meant to show the works and pictures of an artist.
Due to potential copyright issues, I have not included the pictures used in the webpages.

The webpages were made in 2011.
The file names are written in Finnish, but the code should still be understandable to english speakers.
