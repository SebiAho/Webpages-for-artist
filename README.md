# Webpages-for-artist
Webpages I made for my Vocational Institute studies.
The now defunct webpages were essentially an art gallery, meant to show the works and pictures of an artist.
Due to potential copyright issues, I have not included the pictures used in the webpages.
Note: that I only made the pages, NOT the pictures.

The webpages were made in 2011 using Notepad++.
The file names are written in Finnish, but the code should still be understandable to english speakers.

"Webpage Code" folder contains the code used in the webpages.
"Webpage Screenshots" folder contains screenshots of the site.
